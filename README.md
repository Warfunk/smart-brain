  A project built with guidance of Zero to Mastery Academy. The smart-brain app was built as a final project using many full stack tools: React, Tachyons, Node, Express, PostgreSQL. React and Tachyons were used to build the front end UI interface where users can input image urls and the app will display boxes around the faces. Users were able to register and sign in order to keep track of the number of photos checked for faces. Postgres was used to store the data of users and connected to the front end with Node. Node was also used to verify users and fetch the Clarafai API wich detected the faces in the photo. Express was used as the middleware to run the server.
